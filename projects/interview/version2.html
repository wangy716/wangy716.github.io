		<strong>Why did you choose communication design as your major?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>When it came to choosing an art field to work within, I knew I was very drawn towards typography and visual culture as a whole. On top of that, I really enjoyed the diverse subfields that are offered in this major. Between UX/UI design to editorial and brand-based projects, there are so many exciting opportunities I am keen to explore</div>
</div>

	<h2>Evelyn</h2>

	<div class="q1">
		<strong>Is there anything you will always inspire from or given a muse for you to create/design?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>I find a lot of inspiration in the past and nature. I really enjoy research, especially historical and scientific investigations, and doing so is a big part of my creative process. I like having a nice set of notes to peruse while trying to develop a design idea. </div>
</div>

<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>Do you have any people to look forward to?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>I am really inspired by many designers and artists, but I am especially drawn to the work and processes of Terry Gilliam, Shona Heath, Paula Scher, and Satyajit Ray. They are all creatives who have discussed their work styles in very candid ways that I found myself relating to and even emulating. On top of that, they are all based in fields (graphic design, editorial art direction, animation) that I highly enjoy and would love to delve into. Each individual designer has an immensely diverse body of work and I really admire their ability to explore such a wide range of projects.

	<div class="q1">
		<strong>What is your goal after three years of communication design study?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>Wow, that is a difficult question. I think I want to look back at my schooling and feel satisfied with making the most out of the opportunities I have received. I want to have a better grasp of the specific fields I want to work in and feel more confident about my personal creative opinions.
</div>
</div>

	<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>What other medium arts have you done?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>Honestly, I didn't immensely care for working in a digital space too much before beginning college. I really enjoyed painting, pen and ink, and pastels, and still try to use them in my side projects. But after my first year, I learned that I actually really enjoyed working in 3D with wire and metal, and creating animated and still-image films. I am glad that the first year of college gave me the chance to experiment with all of these different mediums and styles.</div>
</div>

<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>In general, what do you think art has brought to you? (either positive and negative)
</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>Wow, that's also a really good question! I think working in art and design has just been such an overarching aspect of my life and I find it (positively) seeping into many other aspects of living. By developing my creative process, I found that I was able to get a better grasp on writing essays, reading and analyzing texts, and just solving day-to-day problems. I must say that art has also brought me quite a lot of stress and very little sleep. It can get difficult to balance fearlessness with a desire to reach 'perfection' and that can result in a lot of frustration and burnout.</div>
</div>

<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>How do you define art?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>To me, art is a crossroads between making and expression. It's a really fascinating way of producing something from within and putting it out for others to see.</div>
</div>

<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>Besides art, what would you like to do?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>Besides art, I really love to cook. It's my number one way to destress and I love that by the end of it, I have something that can be used and enjoyed. I especially enjoy cooking for others, even though it's a bit tough in my tiny New York kitchen now. I find myself going through the creative process in cooking and baking too, so I guess that's another way art has positively impacted me.</div>
</div>

<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>What is your ideal dream life? To be given a day to live perfectly, how would you plan out?</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r>An ideal lifestyle for me would entail a nice work/life balance. I tend to focus too much on work and then experience burnout, which can be pretty irritating. I would really love to eradicate my procrastination/desire for perfection and give myself enough time to sleep and have fun.</div>
</div>

<div class=square1>
	<h2>Evelyn</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="q1">
		<strong>What do you most believe in for life?
</strong>
	</div>
<br>

<div class=square2>
  	<div class=rn><h2>Shravani</h2></div>
  	<div class=r> I honestly don't know. I guess I just really value the power of experience? I don't know if I have a solid amount of faith in really anything, but I do admire learning about others and perspectives outside of my own. I just like that process of learning and the realization of how different other people/experiences can be. I don't know if that really answers the question, but it's the closest I can think of to truly believing in something.</div>
